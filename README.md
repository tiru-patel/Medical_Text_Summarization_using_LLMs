## About the Project

Due to the rapid expansion of medical literature, keeping pace with the latest
research and clinical guidelines has become more challenging for healthcare pro-
fessionals. To overcome this challenge, effective text summarization is crucial for
improving access to knowledge, enhancing clinical decision-making, and ultimately
benefiting patient outcomes. In this study, a medical text summarization system
that employs large language models (LLMs) is fine-tuned and evaluated with the
objective of generating precise, logical, and brief summaries of medical literature,
emphasizing clinical relevance and ease of understanding. The projects focus on evaluating the
performance of GPT3, GPT4 and the fine-tuned T5, BART and Pegasus model
trained on the standard PubMed dataset using standard evaluation metrics.
