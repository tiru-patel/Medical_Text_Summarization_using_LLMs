              "\" \\n\\nAnxiety affects the quality of life of those living with Parkinson's Disease (PD) more than overall cognitive status, motor deficits, apathy, and depression. Although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in PD patients, research suggests that anxiety is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder. Current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in PD, as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices, is limited. Neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD have been associated with poorer cognitive performance. A study of 27 PD patients showed a negative relationship between anxiety and cognitive performance. Two further studies examined the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition, but their findings were inconsistent. This study compared the cognition of PD patients with and without anxiety, excluding depression. Results showed that PD patients with anxiety had worse performance on attentional set-shifting, working memory, and verbal memory tests compared to PD patients without anxiety. Neurochemical changes such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion, as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei, may explain the cognitive impairments seen in PD patients with anxiety. Future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation, as well as examining whether treating neuropsychiatric\""
